# Mohanhospital_website
Made a website for a Multi-Speciality Hospital [Mohan Hospital &amp; Ultrasound Scan Centre] in WordPress using Elementor.
Started the Work about 5 days back and now the website is almost complete with some minor changes

----MAJOR LEARNINGS----
1. Taught me how to communicate with the clients and be punctual for daily progress reports
2. Learnt different Elementor plugins and studied some Design things[color-patters, hovering effects, dealing with different sections].
3. Understood majorly, how even without doing so much code things connect to deliver good eye-catching websites.
4. As a Frontend  Developer one, must also consider mobile and tablet view for the website [New Learning].
