# Mohanhospital_website
Using Elementor, I created a WordPress website for Mohan Hospital & Ultrasound Scan Centre, a multi-specialty hospital. I began work on the website around five days ago, and with a few little tweaks, it is nearly finished today.
----PRIMARY LESSONS----
1. Taught me how to interact with clients and how to deliver on time for daily progress reports
2. Acquired knowledge of several Elementor plugins and explored design concepts, such as color patterns, hovering effects, and merging diff. Sections
3. Have a solid understanding of how, even without writing a lot of code, things work together to create attractive websites.
4. A new challenge for me was to take into account how the website will appear on tablets and smartphones [New Learning].
