WELCOME TO MY PROFILE. You are reviewing Project Cura.
Description:
Using Elementor, I created a WordPress website for Mohan Hospital & Ultrasound Scan Centre, a multi-specialty Hospital. I completed work on the website in five days and with a few little tweaks.

----PRIMARY LESSONS----
1. Taught me how to interact with clients and how to deliver on time for daily progress reports
2. Acquired knowledge of several Elementor plugins and explored design concepts, such as color patterns, hovering effects, and merging diff. Sections
3. Understand how, even without writing much code, things work together to create attractive websites.
4. A new challenge for me was to consider how the website would appear on tablets and smartphones [New Learning].
